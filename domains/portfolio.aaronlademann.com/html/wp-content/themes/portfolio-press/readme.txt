Instructions and Common Questions
---------------------------------

How to Set Up a Portfolio Item:

When you activate the Portfolio Theme, you will see a new post type called "Portfolio".  Click "Add New Item" and you will be taken to the edit page where you can add a title, description, and tags for your portfolio piece.

To add the portfolio image, click "Set featured image" on the right side of the screen beneath "Portfolio Tags".  This will take you to the media uploader to add your image.  When you finish, click "Use as Featured Image".

404 Errors:

This theme uses custom post types.  If you are getting a 404 error when you try and view the portfolio posts, reset your permalinks.  You can do this by going to "Settings > Permalinks" and re-saving the permalink structure.

Portfolio Items Disappear:

If you change themes, chances are your portfolio pieces will disappear from the dashboard.  Fear not!  They are still saved in the database- your new theme just wasn't programmed to list and display them.

If you are handy with code, you can just copy the two extensions "portfolio-post-type.php" and "simple-custom-post-type-archives.php" into your new theme and call them from the functions.php file.  You'll also have to build new template files to display the custom post types in your theme.  If coding isn't your thing, you could hire a WordPress developer to help you out with the project.
