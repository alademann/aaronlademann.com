        <span>All three deserve a fourth star based on their dominance in the high school game, and/or the quality of their offers. Ashton Glaser could probably be added here as well. </span></td>

While there are more 2* guys this year than last, we should trust Pinkel's staff - and their evaluations. Add Wingo, Hawthorne and a few pleasant surprises, and this class is another huge success. </span><br /><br />

      <span> Carl still has the potential to play well above a 3 star ranking right now. Not only did he start as a true frosh, he was flat out dominant. He dropped off a bit with a sophomore slump, but still looked good at times.</span><br /></td>
    <td style="font-size: .7em;" valign="top"><span>A very good class, turning out none other than Carl Gettis - and very promising athletes like Keck, Moye, and Washington. However, the total of 10 5.6 or higher is a little deceiving, as only 5 of them are 5.7 or above. A lot of &quot;mid-level&quot; 3 stars in this class. </span></td>

        <strong>Pig Brown </strong>(NR)<br />
        <span>whhhiffff. Will always be remembered as a &quot;what if&quot; player. What if he hadn't been injured - would Missouri have won the 2008 National Title? </span><br />

        <strong>Spoon </strong>(5.2)<br />
        <span><strong style="color: red;"> NFL PLAYER.</strong> ouch, not even close. Rivals scouts should be very thankful they do their job in the stands, and not in Spoon's crosshairs.</span>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>'Nario </strong>(5.0)... <br />
        <span>he might have been injured, but again towards the end of this season - he showed why most pro scouts consider him the best pro prospect on our team except for Jmac.</span>
    </td>
    <td style="font-size: .7em;" valign="top"><span>On paper, the class looked very weak, with only one 5.7, no 5.6's and a bunch of 5.5's or NR Juco players. However, this class has proven to have a few (but very, very important) studs. 3 of the guys listed in the whiff column are the future of our team, and one inspired one of the greatest seasons of Tiger football - this year. Rivals should have to publish a formal apology for some of the rankings of these players. </span></td>

      <strong>Chase Coffman </strong>(5.6)<span><br />
<strong style="color: red;"> NFL PLAYER.</strong> The biggest whiff in Rivals history. is FIVE stars in every way you can be... height, hands, demeanor, etc... Anyone who looked at his HS film and said he wasn't a 4 star - should be mentally evaluated by someone in a lab coat.</span><br />
<br />
      <strong>Ziggy </strong>(5.5)<span><br />
<strong style="color: red;"> NFL PLAYER.</strong> is a beast. If not a four star, he should have been at least a high three star. The gold grille alone is worth .2 or .3 RR points.</span></td>
    <td style="font-size:.7em;" valign="top"><span>This class will forever be remembered as the year we landed the savior of Missouri football. Slice it any way you want, Chase Daniel has brought exposure and winning to our University like no one in our school's history. The fact he was rated so low out of high school makes the story that much better.<br />
        <br />
The class as a whole has produced some very productive players, and a few that won't soon be forgotten. </span></td>

 	  <br />
 	  As you can see, Pinkel and Co. have continued to improve the overall quality of the talent. Even though many &quot;whiffs&quot; can be pointed out, a points system like RR is a great way to look at overall success for a recruiting class. This year, the 2009 class has been bemoaned by many on recruiting message boards - but really without a solid foundation in reality. We can still take a bigger step forward, but we're not &quot;falling off&quot;, either. All of Pinkel's recruiting classes must be taken with a grain of salt as their recruiting evaluation methods tend to dig up more 2* gems rather than taking a chance on a bunch of 4* head cases.<br />
