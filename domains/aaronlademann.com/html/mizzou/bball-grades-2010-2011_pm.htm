I wanted to do a follow-up on the <a rel="nofollow" style="color:#08c;" target="_blank" href="http://missouri.rivals.com/showmsg.asp?fid=489&tid=155952849&mid=155952849&sid=898&style=2">"Mizzou BBall Grades"</a> thead started by icyb94.  I agreed with parts of his analysis, but disagree with others.<br /><br />Where I think he faltered in his analysis is not factoring in experience and expectations. Younger players can simply NOT be expected to perform at an "A" level except in rare situations.  We really lacked experience this year - and we lacked Senior leadership even more than that.<br><br>What I wanted to do more than anything though - was grade the players with more of a statistical basis instead of 100% opinion. I'm not saying my grades below are 0% opinion - I'm saying that my opinion is based much more heavily in statistics.<br><br><strong>Here is my "formula" for grading individuals</strong> <br><hr /><br><h3 style="margin-bottom:0;"><font color="gray">[(</font>Skills <font color="gray">+</font> <em style="color:red;">Intangibles</em><font color="gray">) - ((</font>Years of D1 Experience<font color="gray">) *</font> <em style="color:blue;">Expectations</em><font color="gray">)] /</font> 10</h3>
<br><ul><br>	<li><em>The <font color="blue">expectations</font> portion of the formula above is a decimal from 0.0 to 1.0<br /><br>			<strong>0.0</strong> (no expectations for productive minutes) would be a walk-on, <strong><br /><br>	
1.0		</strong> would be a 5 star / McD AA type player in their Junior/Senior year</em><br>	</li><br>	<li><em>The <font color="red">intangibles</font> portion of the formula above are points added up just like skill points <br />Intangibles can be anything from leadership capacity, to hustle, etc...</em><br />
</li>
<li>The <strong>years of D1 experience</strong> number has a minimum of .8 for those who have 0 years experience</li>
</ul>
<br><br><hr /><br>The point of the formula is to get a number that represents how their season went based not just on our expectations as a fan base, but also what is expected of upperclassmen in general. <br> <br>
If a Senior 4* recruit has a "so-so" season, only tallying up 10 points in the skills and intangibles area, their grade will be lower. <br>
<br>
I feel strongly that the EXPECTATIONS - and the years of EXPERIENCE D1 are significant enough that they should be significant in the overall "grade" of a player.<br>
